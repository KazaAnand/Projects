# 🎓 Student Marks & Details Management System

## 📘 Overview

The **Student Marks & Details Management System** is a **console-based Java project** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **Java Collections**.
It helps manage student records efficiently — including personal details, subject-wise marks, total, percentage, and grade calculation — all through a simple text-based menu.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
StuDB/
│
├── StudentDetails.java        # Stores individual student info and marks
├── StudentManagement.java     # Handles all CRUD operations and sorting
└── StudentApp.java                  # Console-based menu and program execution
```
